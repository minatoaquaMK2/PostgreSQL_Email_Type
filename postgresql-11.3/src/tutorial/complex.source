-----------------------------
-- Creating a new type:
--	We are going to create a new type called 'complex' which represents
--	complex numbers.
--	A user-defined type must have an input and an output function, and
--	optionally can have binary input and output functions.  All of these
--	are usually user-defined C functions.
-----------------------------

-- Assume the user defined functions are in _OBJWD_/complex$DLSUFFIX
-- (we do not want to assume this is in the dynamic loader search path).
-- Look at $PWD/complex.c for the source.  Note that we declare all of
-- them as STRICT, so we do not need to cope with NULL inputs in the
-- C code.  We also mark them IMMUTABLE, since they always return the
-- same outputs given the same inputs.

-- the input function 'complex_in' takes a null-terminated string (the
-- textual representation of the type) and turns it into the internal
-- (in memory) representation. You will get a message telling you 'complex'
-- does not exist yet but that's okay.

CREATE FUNCTION email_in(cstring)
   RETURNS complex
   AS '_OBJWD_/complex'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

-- the output function 'complex_out' takes the internal representation and
-- converts it into the textual representation.

CREATE FUNCTION email_out(EmailAddr)
   RETURNS cstring
   AS '_OBJWD_/complex'
   LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;


CREATE TYPE EmailAddr (
   input = email_in,
   output = email_out  
);
